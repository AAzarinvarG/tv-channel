      description: `Survivor Turkey is the Turkish version of the popular reality series Survivor. This version of the show has aired on both Kanal D in 2005, and on Show TV in 2006, 2007, and 2010. From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

      description: `Survivor Turkey is the Turkish version of the popular reality series Survivor. This version of the show has aired on both Kanal D in 2005, and on Show TV in 2006, 2007, and 2010. From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

      description: `Survivor Turkey is the Turkish version of the popular reality series Survivor. This version of the show has aired on both Kanal D in 2005, and on Show TV in 2006, 2007, and 2010. From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

      description: `Survivor Turkey is the Turkish version of the popular reality series Survivor. This version of the show has aired on both Kanal D in 2005, and on Show TV in 2006, 2007, and 2010. From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,

      description: `Survivor Turkey is the Turkish version of the popular reality series Survivor. This version of the show has aired on both Kanal D in 2005, and on Show TV in 2006, 2007, and 2010. From the beginning Survivor was a success in Turkey, however, the cost of producing the show proved to be too much for Kanal D and even Show TV could not afford to produce the show on a yearly basis. Because of production costs the show was put on hiatus in 2007 and was brought back three years later. The prize for the first seasons of the show was 150,000 euros, for the second and third seasons 250,000 euros, and 500,000 dollars for the fourth season. Turkish Survivor followed a similar format as the American Survivor, but with some differences. In the Turkish version, there are some minor changes in each season when it comes to how the game is played, how contestants are eliminated, and how the game is won. One thing that has not changed throughout the seasons is that in order to win the game a contestant must earn the most "points", these points are typically earned through votes or winning challenges. Unlike the original series, viewers vote for their favourites to select the winner each week and in the final. The players never cast votes during tribal councils since the inception of the Turkish series which eliminates the most important part of the US series. Another major difference is the length of the show (multiple episodes a week, around 180mins per episode).`,
